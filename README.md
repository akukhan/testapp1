Features to Enhance
User Profile Management

Add fields for nickname, height, weight, and BMI to the database.
Allow users to update their height/weight over time to recalculate BMI dynamically.
Show BMI in the stats tab with a chart showing its change over time.
Local Time Support

Ensure all date-time values are saved and displayed in the user’s local time zone.
Use JavaScript's Intl.DateTimeFormat or moment-timezone for consistent local time formatting.
Step Tracking

Save cumulative steps for the day in the database.
Allow users to view their daily step history (e.g., last 7 days, month, or custom range).
Add graphs to show step trends over time using libraries like VictoryNative or react-native-chart-kit.
Enhanced Step Validation

Integrate additional filters to detect false positives in step tracking (e.g., jumps in step count).
Improve accuracy by combining pedometer data with linear acceleration for activity analysis.
Activity Insights

Track activity type (Walking, Running, Idle, etc.) using accelerometer and gyroscope data.
Display time spent in each activity category (e.g., 30 minutes walking, 10 minutes running).
Add a tab for “Activity Insights” with pie charts or bar graphs.
Calories Burned

Calculate calories burned using the user’s weight, step count, and activity type.
Display daily, weekly, and monthly calories burned stats in a separate tab.
Daily Reminders

Allow users to set reminders (e.g., walk every hour or complete 10,000 steps by evening).
Send reminders using local notifications.
Health Goals

Add customizable health goals (e.g., step goals, weight goals, etc.).
Track progress toward goals and show achievements visually (e.g., badges).
Additional Metrics

Distance walked: Calculate based on steps and average stride length (derived from height).
Average speed: Calculate using time and distance.
Floors climbed: If the app supports altitude sensors, track floors climbed.
Sleep tracking: If feasible, track sleep using accelerometer and gyroscope data.
Export Data

Allow users to export their step and activity data to CSV or JSON for offline analysis.
